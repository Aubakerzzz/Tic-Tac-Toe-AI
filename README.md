# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. The game allows you to play against an AI opponent using the Alpha-Beta algorithm.

## Game Rules

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their symbol (X or O). The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the opponent does.

## How to Run the Game

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
3. Open the project folder in your preferred C++ development environment.
4. Compile the source code (`main.cpp`) using the C++ compiler.
5. Run the compiled executable file to start the game.
6. Follow the prompts to make your moves and play against the AI opponent.
7. The game will display the final board and announce the winner or a draw.
